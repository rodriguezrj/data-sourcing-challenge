# Movie Reviews Data Analysis

This project retrieves movie reviews from The New York Times API and extracts relevant information such as movie titles, review details, and publication dates. It also queries The Movie Database (TMDb) to obtain additional details about the movies mentioned in the reviews, such as genres, spoken languages, and production countries. The data is then merged and analyzed to gain insights into the relationship between movie reviews and movie attributes.
